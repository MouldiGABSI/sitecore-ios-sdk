Sitecore Mobile SDK 1.2 for iOS
======================================

Sitecore Mobile SDK is a framework that is designed to help the developer produce iOS based applications that use and serve content that is managed by Sitecore. The framework offers both Objective-C and JavaScriptAPI that enable developers to rapidly develop applications utilising their existing IOS or web development skill sets. The SDK includes the following features:

 * Left-Right swipe navigation
 * Access to the camera and the photo library
 * QR code usage (scan and use QR Codes)
 * Accelerometer functions
 * Device information
 * Access to the built-in address book and easy creation of new contacts
 * Sending emails using the e-mail account
 * Social networks integration (Facebook, Twitter)
 * Mapping integration (with both Apple Maps and Google Maps)


The applications powered by this SDK support both IOS 6 and IOS 7, and can request content from Sitecore efficiently and securely via Sitecore Item Web API RESTful web service.

As a part of the most recent update (SDK 1.2 for IOS) we have created a sample application that can be used as a starting point to understand the Mobile SDK for iOS and the features available. This project can be found on github insert github hyperlink here
